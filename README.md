Blues Trivia: As in Pantone Blues

There are console los left in so users can get some answers correct to see how that functions.

Some things that could be fixed if this were a longer project:

the hover over the buttons doesn't clear,
the Electric Blue Lemonade label runs over the button,
the timer isn't exactly centered,
the question box could have more interesting styling.
